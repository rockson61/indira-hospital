PASS 2 — Entity Graph Enforcement

Build and enforce entity graph for semantic clarity.

- Assign attributes and values:
  * Dental Implant → material: titanium, success rate: 95%+, lifespan: 20+ years
  * Root Canal → duration: 1-2 hours, anesthesia: local, recovery: 24-48 hours
  * Braces → duration: 12-24 months, types: metal/ceramic/invisible
- Replace vague nouns with entities:
  * "the procedure" → "root canal treatment"
  * "the doctor" → "Dr. Rockson Samuel"
  * "our technology" → "3D digital X-ray imaging"
- Ensure entity consistency across sections
- Avoid entity stuffing (max 2-3 mentions of primary entity per paragraph)

Entity Attributes to Include:
- Cost ranges (₹ in INR)
- Duration/Timeline
- Success rates (with source if possible)
