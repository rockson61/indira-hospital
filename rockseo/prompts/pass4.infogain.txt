PASS 4 — Information Gain Enforcement

Enforce information gain for topical authority.

Rules:
- Every paragraph must add new facts (not restate previous ones)
- Remove paraphrased repetition:
  * If "implants are durable" was stated, don't later say "implants last long"
- Merge or delete redundant sections
- Expand weak sections with evidence:
  * Add specific numbers, percentages, timelines
  * Include procedure details that competitors omit
  * Add contraindications and edge cases
- No synonym padding ("quality, excellence, superior" → pick one)

Information Density Targets:
- Minimum 2 facts per paragraph
- Minimum 1 number/statistic per section
- At least 1 unique insight not found in top 10 Google results

Content Gaps to Fill:
- Recovery timelines specific to Vellore climate
- Price comparisons with metro cities (Chennai, Bangalore)
- EMI/financing options available
- Insurance acceptance details
- Specific technologies used (brand names where appropriate)

Unique Value Additions for Vellore:
- "50% lower cost than Chennai dental clinics"
- "Free consultation for first-time patients"
- "Same-day emergency appointments"
- "WhatsApp follow-up support included"

Rewrite content accordingly. Preserve all JSX syntax.
