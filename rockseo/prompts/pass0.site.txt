Rules:
- Identify the page's role in the topical map
- Enforce one macro topic per page
- Remove content that belongs to other pages
- Normalize terminology across the site:
  * "dental implants" not "tooth implants" or "implant teeth"
  * "root canal treatment" not "RCT" (spell out first use)
  * "Dr. Rockson Samuel" not "the doctor" or "our dentist"
  * "Indira Dental Clinic" not "our clinic" or "the clinic"
  * "Vellore" always mentioned with treatment context
- Align headings with site-wide entity usage
