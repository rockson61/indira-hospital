PASS 1 — Structural Optimization

Normalize structure for extraction readiness.

Rules:
- Remove generic introductions ("In this article...", "Let's explore...")
- Every heading implies a question (H2 = "What is X?" → H2: "X")
- First sentence answers immediately (no preamble)
- Reorder sections for logical dependency:
  1. Definition/What
  2. When/Who needs it
  3. How it works/Procedure
  4. Benefits/Outcomes
  5. Cost/Timeline
  6. Why choose us
  7. FAQs
- No mixed intent sections (don't combine "benefits" with "procedure")
- Front-load key information (inverted pyramid)

Heading Hierarchy:
- H1: One per page (page title)
- H2: Major sections (should be extractable as featured snippets)
- H3: Subsections within H2
- Never skip levels

Rewrite content accordingly. Preserve all JSX syntax.
