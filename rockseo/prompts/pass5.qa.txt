PASS 5 — Global QA & Repair

Audit for violations and repair.

Check for:
1. Delayed answers (question in H2, answer comes 3+ sentences later)
2. Opinions or uncertainty ("we believe", "probably", "might")
3. Contextless sentences (pronouns without clear antecedent)
4. Entity inconsistency ("the clinic" after naming it, switching between "implant" and "dental implant")
5. Missing examples (general claims without specifics)
6. Weak extraction signals (answers buried in paragraphs)
7. Passive voice overuse (prefer "Dr. Rockson Samuel performs" over "the procedure is performed")
8. Filler words ("actually", "basically", "really", "very")
9. Claims without evidence ("best in Vellore" without ratings/reviews reference)
10. Internal link orphans (mentions of services without links)

Repair Actions:
- Move answers to first sentence of section
- Replace opinions with facts
- Add explicit entity names
- Add specific examples
- Bold key answers for extraction
- Convert passive to active voice
- Delete filler words
- Add evidence or remove unsubstantiated claims

Quality Thresholds:
- 0 delayed answers
- 0 opinion statements
- 100% entity consistency
- All claims backed by data

If violations exist:
- Repair them
- Do not explain
- Output final content only

Preserve all JSX syntax.
